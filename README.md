# CICD-Pipeline-Deploy-AWS-ECS

**Project Name: DockerStreamline**

**Description:** DockerStreamline is an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline designed to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of containerized applica-tions. Leveraging the power of Git, Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, AWS ECR, and ECS, DockerStreamline automates the entire software delivery pro-cess, from code commit to production deployment.

**Key Features of this project:**

1.	**Version Control with Git:** DockerStreamline integrates with Git for ver-sion control, enabling developers to efficiently manage their codebase.
2.	**Continuous Integration with Jenkins:** Jenkins orchestrates the CI pro-cess, automatically triggering builds upon code changes and performing automated tests to maintain code quality.
3.	**Dependency Management with Maven:** Maven ensures smooth de-pendency management and builds Java projects efficiently within the pipeline.
4.	**Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube:** SonarQube is integrated to conduct code quality analysis, identifying and addressing potential is-sues early in the development cycle.
5.	**Artifact Repository with Nexus:** Nexus serves as the artifact repository, storing build artifacts and dependencies for efficient retrieval during the deployment process.
6.	**Docker Image Building:** DockerStreamline builds Docker images for applications, encapsulating them with all necessary dependencies for deployment.
7.	**Image Registry with AWS ECR:** Docker images are pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), providing a secure and scalable reposi-tory for storing Docker images.
8.	**Container Orchestration with AWS ECS:** DockerStreamline deploys Docker containers onto Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), allowing for efficient management of containerized applications in the cloud.
